# Lab: Monitoring Cloud Deployments with AWS

## Overview

In this lab, I will explore several AWS services used to monitor cloud environments for application health, performance, and operational insights. Monitoring is a key function in cloud deployments as it helps ensure a positive customer experience, supports developer productivity, and provides actionable data for system improvements.

Using the **AWS Management Console**, I will work with tools such as:

- **Amazon CloudWatch**
- **AWS CloudTrail**
- Other AWS observability services

These tools will help track metrics, analyze logs, set alarms, and provide visibility into the behavior and performance of deployed applications.

This lab focuses on learning how to maintain and optimize cloud resources effectively using built-in AWS monitoring capabilities.
